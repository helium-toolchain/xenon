Xenon is a work-in-progress Minecraft launcher, intended to both be highly extendable and support both servers and clients, first-party as well as third-party. In this sense, 
Xenon can be interpreted as a general application launcher.

Xenon's modular infrastructure is mostly based on the concept of Installers. Installers are separately served assemblies implementing a specific protocol - see the 
[Installer specification](/reference/installers). They can be added and removed freely from the Xenon executables. Built-in support for downloading and uploading installers 
is planned.
